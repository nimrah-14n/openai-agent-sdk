(zh\u00e8 sh\u00ec...)** - This is the most common way to say \"This is...\"  It's used for singular, near objects.  You would follow \"... \" with the noun. For example:  \u8fd9\u662f\u4e66 (zh\u00e8 sh\u00ec sh\u016b) - This is a book.\n\n* **\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f... (zh\u00e8 xi\u0113 sh\u00ec...)** - This is used for plural, near objects.  For example: \u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u82f9\u679c (zh\u00e8 xi\u0113 sh\u00ec p\u00ednggu\u01d2) - These are apples.\n\n* **\u90a3\u662f... (n\u00e0 sh\u00ec...)** - This means \"That is...\" for singular, far objects.\n\n* **\u90a3\u4e9b\u662f... (n\u00e0 xi\u0113 sh\u00ec...)** - This means \"Those are...\" for plural, far objects.\n\n\nTherefore, to accurately translate \"This is...\" into Chinese, you need to specify what \"this\" refers to and whether it's singular or plural, and near or far.\n"
